Short of Light is a mini-game created as a personal project, written entirely in vanilla JavaScript using the [Canvas element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp). Feel free to reach out for any questions, comments, or suggestions!

## Introduction

You've fallen into a **deep slumber**. A nightmare from which there is seemingly **no escape**. A series of stretching hallways and confusing rooms stand between you and the **light of day**.
But you mustn't lose hope. Confront your **shadows**, find your inner strength and fight to **wake up again**.

## Instructions

- Use your **arrow** or **wasd** keys to move around the map (You can also use an on-screen joystick when playing on mobile). **Esc** to pause.
- You'll only be able to see in the **direction you are facing**.
- You must find and confront your **shadows** to unlock your way out.
- Once you found them, **return to where you first started** to finally wake up.
- While you search, you'll find **oil canisters** to refill your lamp.
- If your lamp runs out of oil, you'll be **trapped in your nightmare forever**.
